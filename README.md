I've developed a Flutter application with the following features:

Google Sign-In Authentication: Users can log in using their Gmail accounts.

User Information Display: Upon login, the app displays the user's email and other available Gmail information.

Firebase Integration: A new user entry is created in Firebase upon successful login.

Home Screen Form: Users can input their address, phone number, select their age from a dropdown, and enter additional information in a free text box. All inputs are validated appropriately.

Supabase Integration: The data entered by users is stored securely in Supabase.

Navigation Menu: Includes options to navigate to two different screens:

Logout Screen: Allows users to log out and return to the home screen.

Delete Data Screen: Enables users to delete their data from Supabase and return to the home screen.

Persistent Data: Upon logging back in, users can view the information they previously entered and saved.
